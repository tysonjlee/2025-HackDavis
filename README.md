## What Is ClubHub?

ClubHub is a centralized platform that allows UC Davis students to browse a directory of campus clubs, connect with club admins, view announcements and events, and stay engaged with campus life. Students can search for clubs, view mutual clubs with friends, and keep track of meetings through a built-in club calendar.

## More About the Project

### Inspiration  
We explored several project ideas before realizing how difficult it can be for students to discover and join clubs on campus—especially when applications reopen each quarter. We wanted to create a better way to connect students to communities.

### What It Does  
ClubHub makes it easy to discover and follow clubs, find shared interests with friends, and manage involvement through a personalized calendar system.

### How We Built It  
We used React and Next.js for the front-end, Supabase for authentication, storage, and database management, and Tailwind with shadcn/ui for UI components. Development was supported by GitHub, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT.

### Challenges We Ran Into  
As first-time GitHub users, we faced difficulties with branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Setting up Supabase and integrating it cleanly into the front-end also posed a learning curve.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
We successfully built a working full-stack web app with user authentication, a functional club browsing experience, friend connections, and a clean UI. Our backend also securely stores user avatars, club data, and login credentials.

### What We Learned  
We learned how to work with frameworks like Supabase, how to build and deploy modern web apps using React and Next.js, and how to collaborate using GitHub. We also discovered how helpful AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT can be in learning and debugging.

### What's Next for ClubHub  
We’d love to scale ClubHub by integrating real UC Davis club data using a web scraper, adding map-based location previews, expanding to other campuses, improving club tagging and filtering, enriching club descriptions, and strengthening backend security.
